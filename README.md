## Problem Statement

Provide an overview of the data collected and share some ideas on how we can optimize our loyalty program to better meet the needs of our customers. Help airlines know if their customers are satisfied with their services. This way, through the use of this panel, we will be able to implement a set of promotions and discounts in certain months.

### Steps followed 

- Step 1 : Load data into Power BI Desktop, the dataset is a CSV file.
- Step 2 : Open the model view tab & make some relations between "Loyalty Number"
- Step 3 : Convert from text to currency Salary & CLV from Customer Loyalty History table.
- Step 4 : Create Lost, MonthInNameCancelm & MonthInNameEnroll column from the Customer Loyalty History table.
- Step 5 : For calculating the lost column, need to sum CLV times count Cancellation Year divided by the count of Cancellation Year from the Customer Loyalty History table.
- Step 6 : In the report view, under the view tab, the report was divided into three sections.
- Step 7 : Since the data contains various ratings, it represents Profits, Median salary, total flights, total members, and more. 
- Step 8 : Another tab was added to represent the total memberships canceled, per year, per marital status, and month.
